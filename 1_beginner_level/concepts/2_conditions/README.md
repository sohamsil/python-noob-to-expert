# 📝 Python Basics: Conditional Statements, Logical Operators & Match-Case

This Python module demonstrates key decision-making constructs in Python using a student evaluation system. It includes examples of `if-else`, logical operators, and the modern `match-case` statement introduced in Python 3.10.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

#### ✅ If-Else Statements
>Used to evaluate whether a student has passed based on their marks.
>
>Provides feedback and suggestions based on the result.
#### ✅ Logical Operators
>Utilizes `and`, `or`, and `not` to determine student grades.
>
>Implements multi-condition logic to offer relevant course discounts.
#### ✅ Match-Case (Switch Case)
>Introduces the `match-case` statement (Python 3.10+).
>
>Provides a cleaner alternative to multiple `if-elif-else` blocks for grade-based logic.


## ⚙️ Requirements
>Python 3.10 or above (for `match-case` support)
