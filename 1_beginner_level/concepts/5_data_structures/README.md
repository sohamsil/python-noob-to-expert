# 📝 Python Basics: Data Structures - Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples

This Python module demonstrates the use of fundamental data structures in Python, including `lists`, `dictionaries`, `sets`, and `tuples`. These examples cover their creation, manipulation, and common operations to help understand their usage and differences.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

#### ✅ Lists
>A **list** is a mutable, ordered collection of items that can hold elements of different data types.
>
>Examples include creating lists, accessing elements, slicing, adding, removing, and modifying elements.

#### ✅ Dictionaries
>A **dictionary** is a mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
>
>Examples include creating dictionaries, accessing values by keys, updating values, and working with nested dictionaries.

#### ✅ Sets
>A **set** is an unordered, mutable collection of unique elements.
>
>Examples include creating sets, removing duplicates, and performing operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### ✅ Tuples
>A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable collection of elements.
>
>Examples include creating tuples, accessing elements, and understanding immutability.
