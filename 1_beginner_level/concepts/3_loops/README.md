# 📝 Python Basics: Loops - For Loops & While Loops

This Python module demonstrates the use of loops in Python, focusing on `for` loops and `while` loops. These examples cover various scenarios to help understand iteration in Python.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

#### ✅ For Loops
>Used to iterate over a known number of items, such as elements in a list or a range.
>
>Examples include iterating over lists of integers, strings, mixed data types, and ranges with different configurations.

#### ✅ While Loops
>Used to iterate an unknown number of times, where the number of iterations depends on a condition.
>
>Examples include counting iterations, breaking out of loops, skipping iterations with `continue`, and using `else` with `while`.
