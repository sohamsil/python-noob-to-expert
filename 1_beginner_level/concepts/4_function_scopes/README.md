# 📝 Python Basics: Functions and Variable Scopes

This Python module demonstrates the fundamentals of functions and variable scopes in Python. It includes examples of defining functions, passing arguments, returning values, and understanding different types of variable scopes such as local, enclosing, global, and nonlocal.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

#### ✅ Functions
>Explains how to define functions, pass arguments, and return values.
>
>Includes examples of reusable code blocks for better organization and readability.

#### ✅ Local Scope
>Demonstrates variables defined inside a function, accessible only within that function.

#### ✅ Enclosing Scope
>Shows how variables in an outer function are accessible to nested inner functions.

#### ✅ Nonlocal Scope
>Explains how to modify variables in an enclosing scope using the `nonlocal` keyword.

#### ✅ Global Scope
>Illustrates variables defined outside all functions, accessible throughout the program unless shadowed.

#### ✅ Built-in Functions
>Lists and demonstrates Python's built-in functions, exceptions, and objects using `dir(__builtins__)`.
